1. User Experience & Interface (UI/UX) Enhancements

  These are focused on making the application more polished, modern, and enjoyable to use,
  directly aligning with your UI guidelines.

   * Implement Skeleton Loaders: Replace all simple "Loading..." text with the skeleton
     components we've seen (e.g., InvoicePageSkeleton). This provides a much smoother and
     more professional loading experience, especially on the main dashboard.
   * Create Engaging Empty States: For pages like Invoices, Customers, and Products, when
     the list is empty, we can replace the basic text with a more visually appealing "empty
     state" component that includes an icon or illustration and a clear call-to-action
     button (e.g., "Create Your First Invoice").
   * Dashboard Customization: Allow users to rearrange the widgets on their dashboard using
     drag-and-drop. This gives them the power to prioritize the information that is most
     important to them.
   * Consistent Modal Styling: Ensure all modals (AddCustomerModal, AddPaymentModal, etc.)
     consistently use the "Glassmorphism-Lite" effect (backdrop-blur) mentioned in the UI
     guidelines for a cohesive look and feel.

  2. Core Feature Enhancements

  These suggestions build upon the existing features to make them more powerful and
  efficient.

   * Saved Filters & Views: Allow users to save their frequently used filter and sort
     combinations on the list pages. For example, they could save a view called "Overdue
     High-Value Invoices" and access it with a single click.
   * Bulk Actions: On the Invoices and Customers list pages, add checkboxes to each row to
     allow users to perform bulk actions, such as:
       * Deleting multiple invoices at once.
       * Marking several invoices as "Paid".
       * Exporting selected customers to a CSV file.
   * Advanced Invoice Templates: Create a dedicated section in "Settings" where users can
     create, manage, and set a default invoice template. This would allow for more
     customization than the current "Save as Template" feature.

  3. New High-Impact Features

  These are new capabilities that would significantly expand the application's value.

   * Global Search: Implement a global search bar in the main navigation header. This would
     allow users to instantly search across all their data—invoices, customers, and
     products—from anywhere in the app.
   * Notification Center: Build out the notification system (the bell icon in the header) to
     provide real-time alerts for key events, such as:
       * An invoice has been paid.
       * An invoice becomes overdue.
       * A customer has viewed their invoice online.
   * Dedicated Profile & Settings Pages:
       * Profile Page: A page where users can manage their personal information, password,
         and profile picture.
       * Settings Page: A central hub for managing application preferences, such as theme
         (light/dark mode), date format, currency settings, and notification preferences.

  4. Reporting & Analytics

  Leverage the application's data to provide users with valuable insights into their
  business.

   * Interactive Reporting Dashboard: Create a dedicated "Reports" page with interactive
     charts and data visualizations.
   * New Report Types: Introduce new, valuable reports like:
       * Sales by Customer/Product: See which customers and products are generating the most
         revenue.
       * Tax Summary: A report that simplifies tax filing by summarizing all collected
         taxes.
       * Profit & Loss: By integrating expenses, we can provide a simple P&L statement.
   * Exporting Reports: Allow users to export their reports to PDF or CSV for accounting and
     record-keeping.
